# Workflow: project_cleanup_refactor

## Current Tasks

- Scan all project files for unnecessary code and files
- Identify duplicate logic that can be consolidated
- Reorganize project structure using best architectural practices
- Maintain memory_bank folder integrity

## Plan

1. Analyze all existing files (HTML, CSS, JS, config files)
2. Identify duplicate code patterns and unused code
3. Create a better project structure with separation of concerns
4. Consolidate duplicate logic into reusable modules
5. Remove unnecessary files and clean up remaining files
6. Update documentation and ensure consistency

## Steps

1. Read and analyze all project files
2. Identify code duplication and unused functionality
3. Design improved architecture
4. Refactor and reorganize code
5. Remove unnecessary files
6. Update project structure
7. Validate everything works correctly
