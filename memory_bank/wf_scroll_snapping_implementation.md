# Workflow: scroll_snapping_implementation

## Current Tasks

- Implement scroll snapping with at least 5 slides
- Create minimal slide indicators like the attached image (circular dots)
- Make indicators adaptive to background color (black on light backgrounds, white on dark backgrounds)
- Ensure smooth scrolling experience

## Plan

1. Analyze current HTML structure and CSS
2. Create 5+ slides with different background colors for testing
3. Implement CSS scroll-snap for smooth slide transitions
4. Create minimal circular slide indicators
5. Implement JavaScript to detect background color and adapt indicator colors
6. Add smooth scrolling behavior and indicator highlighting

## Steps

1. Read current HTML and CSS files to understand structure
2. Create slide container with 5+ slides
3. Add CSS scroll-snap properties
4. Create slide indicator component
5. Implement background color detection logic
6. Add indicator highlighting based on current slide
7. Test and refine the implementation
